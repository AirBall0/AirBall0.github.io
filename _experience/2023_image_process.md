– Design a novel sparse log-step gradient prior which adopts a mixture of logarithm and step functions to regularize the image gradients and combine it with the Poisson distribution to formulate the blind multi-image deconvolution problem.\
– Incorporate the methods of variable splitting and Lagrange multiplier to convert the original problem into sub-problems.\
– Design a non-blind multi-image deconvolution algorithm which is based on the log-step gradient prior to reach the final restored image.
